  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Let's pretend this sentence is a bunch of tedious filler that you have to scroll past to get to the recipe.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Parsley</li>
    <li>Spinach</li>
    <li>Cucumber</li>
    <li>Celery</li>
    <li>Green apple</li>
    <li>1 lemon</li>
    <li>Fresh ginger</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <p>Combine handfuls of the ingredients into a juicer. If you don't have a juicer but do have a blender, you might try combining the ingredients with water to make a green smoothie.</p>
